# Digital Garden - theabdullahalam.com
I completely overhauled my personal website to be a digital garden - a network of interlinked ideas that grow and nurture each other over time. There is no endless feed of content. Just a collection of things I deem worth collecting on the internet, and my thoughts on them.

It is a static site generated by 11ty, and I use Obsidian to manage the notes themselves.
