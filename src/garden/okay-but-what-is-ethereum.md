Something to do with blockchains, smart contracts, crypto-currencies and investments? Let's demystify the buzzwords.

Ethereum isn't actually that hard to wrap your head around because it isn't even something completely new in itself - it is merely a clever way of combining technologies that already exist. But when something makes for such an easily accessible financial investment, with returns like it has given recently, investment is all one will find among the top search results. In this post, I shall try to explain what Ethereum really is under the hood, in a more or less layman-friendly manner, sans all the hype. Before we dive into it, firstly, let us understand...

### **How Code is Run**

CPUs do not understand English. They come with a set of instructions that they are capable of executing, and dedicated software is needed to convert code written in English, into instructions for the CPU to execute, called machine code.

Some programming languages come with a middleman known as a virtual machine. They convert code, written in English, into bytecode, which the virtual machine understand. This virtual machine then converts the bytecode into machine code, depending on the OS and CPU it is running on. Java, for example, comes with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that can run Java programs.

The first component of Ethereum is that it too has a virtual machine. In Ethereum, one can write code using a compatible programming language, usually Solidity. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) converts that Solidity code into byte-code, which can be executed on the computer on which the EVM is installed. 'Ethereum programs' are called **smart contracts. That's all a smart contract is - a program that can run on Ethereum.**
