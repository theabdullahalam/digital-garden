how to fall in love with the inevitable rain  
if it is going to wash your favourite puddle away?

how to welcome that fall with a smile which  
will wither away your favourite flowers?

how to look forward to surgery  
when the wound kind of feels nice?

how to look forward to death  
when you can't remember what  
not existing before birth felt like?

how to face the reality of heartbreak  
when you finally feel  
what vulnerability feels like?

sure, one may learn  
not to disturb the reflection but

how does one not want to collect water for himself,  
to keep seeing the moon forever?

how does one not fall in love with the shards,  
when broken glass is all they've seen glints of light in?

how does one dare breathe out, when  
holding a breath in is the only thing  
that overwhelms that knot in their gut?
