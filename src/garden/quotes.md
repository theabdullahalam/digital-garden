>Because the universe is a tautology that can't adequately be put into words. People are lulled into complacency by the illusion that the foundations of existence are banal. So why question what appears to be wrote especially when it upends your world view at the most rudimentary levels? 
>
>People want somewhere else to stand besides here so they can point at everything and say, "There it is. Over there. I understand it all" whether that's through religion or science. That's escape. That's control. The true nature of the universe doesn't allow for that. It's an absurdity. And you can't escape it. That's scary for most. For others it's a relief.

>We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you’re dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.

> We’re all basically building castles in the sand. Whether the surf comes in tomorrow, next year or next decade, don’t kid yourself of its permanence. We’re crafting art for the moment, and tomorrow’s programmers will create new art for tomorrow’s needs.

> Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.
