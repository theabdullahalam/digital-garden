Bring me back to the mighty mountains  
Through layered fogs, standing firm and tall...  
Looming over all my wins and losses,  
Perpetual and unmoving through it all.

Take me there to the peaceful snowcaps,  
To hear snow crunch beneath my sole...  
Join me on a trail unmarked on maps,  
To the only home there is for my soul...

My heart will rest ten thousand feet high,  
Away from street lights or honking cars...  
The milky way spilled across the sky,  
The horizon, a silhouette against the stars...
