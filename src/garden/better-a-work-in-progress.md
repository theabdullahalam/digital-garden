title: Better a Work in Progress

better a work in progress  
than an unfixable mess?  
  
or better a temporary mess  
than an unending work in progress?  
  
works in progress  
live all the lives  
without  
getting stuck up  
on one of them...  
  
a mess is a mess  
only because it was  
once lucky enough  
to be a completed work...  
  
works in progress  
find comfort  
in being in progress...  
  
unfixable messes  
find comfort  
in past laurels...  
  
works in progress  
have no fixed state  
and are forever waiting  
for patterns in the chaos...  
  
messes once did  
have a fixed state  
and are forever waiting  
to be whole again...  
  
both,  
dependent on fate...  
  
both,  
victims of fate...  
  
both,  
fixated on  
the other side...
