title: Drowning in Epiphanies
tags: poetry

Your eyes gape wide in sleepless nights,
Thoughts all racing in despair.
Till one fine day, an answer hits you
That seemed to always be there!

Eyes then open the next morning, 
Without a trace of the faintest frown,
But it merely is a matter of time
'Fore once more the cosmos brings you down...

And then the cruel hands of fate
Bring you back down to your knees,
And it's too late now you realise that,
You were just drowning in epiphanies.
