Lord, they say, you keep this place,  
Will the choir drown my prayer?  
The halls doth echo a thousand whispers,  
O Lord, you really there?  
My Lord, you really there?  

Lord, they say, your wrath and mercy  
know no equal compare.  
Perhaps thence do the lonely souls wonder,  
O Lord, you really there?  
My Lord, you really there?  

Her books of hymn are all worn out.  
His mark's begun to fade.  
The turban threads are crumbling out.  
The flame's begun to jade.  

For every head bowed low in worship,  
Millions join in in despair.  
Till irreverence leaks out in tears,  
O Lord, you really there?  
My Lord, you really there?  

I tried my best to fulfill your wishes;  
Serve every little demand.  
Asked other gods what they want too,  
Blindly did every command.  

We obsess to meet all of your whims,  
a lopsided love affair.  
A winding road with signs that read,  
O Lord, you really there?  
My Lord, you really there?  

Lord, you say you love this place,  
a lopsided love affair.  
Is my prayer getting lost in the choir?  
O Lord, you really there?  
My Lord, you really there?
