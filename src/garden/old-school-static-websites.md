When the Internet was still new, and social media wasn't a thing yet, the world-wide-web was very much like a wild west. It was like a forest that everyone who discovered it loved to explore. There were no fixed paths, no set rules, and everyone did their own thing. Some people loved it and carved out their own little niches in a corner they liked, and they built it and designed it and maintained it however they pleased.

The technology back then was nascent, and the tools available back then were limited. This encouraged a sense of exploration and mutual support. 

And then came blogging platforms and social media sites - websites which made it easier to publish content as well as make it easier to discover other people's content. The undeniable democratisation of the Internet that this led to meant that people are far more restricted from doing their own thing. There was content, but there was no personality. And the endless stream of content brought with it a competition to stay relevant, which, in turn, meant that people would publish content *to stay relevant* rather than just put themselves out there.
