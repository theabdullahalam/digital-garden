One of my favorite themes in science-fiction is where the cosmos does it's own thing, indifferent to what we humans down here are upto.

I got thinking about this in response to the news where the [James Webb telescope got hit by the first micro-meteoroid that caused more damage than initially anticipated.](https://earthsky.org/space/micrometeoroid-strikes-damage-james-webb-space-telescope/) The telescope is expected to cost about $10 billion over it's lifetime, which is quite a significant number, at least for humans. A substantial amount of time, effort and money has been spent into putting the telescope out in space. While the meteoroid didn't really cause any meaningful damage, and the telescope continues to work as expected, it did make me wonder - what if it did? The solar system doesn't care that we spent so much effort into putting it out there. That it (or Earth, for matter) hasn't been hit with a meteoroid large enough to cause serious damage in a while is mere probabilistic luck. With distances this vast, there will always be large gaps of time (at human scales anyways) between impacts.

The book Rendezvous with Rama, by Arthur C. Clarke, evokes a similar feeling. Without giving away too much for those who haven't read it yet, the feeling of humans assuming any significant occurence to be about ourselves when in fact we are not all that important or relevant to the cosmos at all, is a constant theme throughout. It is a haunting (or perhaps humbling?) thought. The reality of it a spector in the room.

Speaking of haunting, this is precisely the feeling that Lovecraftian horror capitlises on. Aptly called 'cosmic horror', Lovecraftian stories drive home the idea that there are entities and energies and gods that exist in the universe whose lives and purposes far outlast our own. That we live our comfortable lives blissfully unaware of our own helplessness and insignificance, and even a glimpse of these entities or ideas is enough to overwhelm man into insanity.

Asimov's Nightfall describes a planet in a such a star system that there is always a sun in the sky at any given moment. However, the stars and the planet arrange in a way that night falls for the first time after thousands of years. This quote from the novel stood out to me -

> "Why had it happened? she asked herself. Why? Why? Why? Were we so evil? Had we strayed so far from the path of the gods that we needed to be punished this way?
> 
> No. No! There are no gods; there was no punishment. Of that much, Siferra was still certain.
> 
> She had no doubt that this was simply the working of blind fate, brought about by the impersonal movements of inaminate and uncaring worlds and suns, drawing together every two thousand years in dispassionate coincidence. That was all. An accident."
