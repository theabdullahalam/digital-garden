Are you there?  
Can you hear me?  
Is there anybody out there  
missing us severely? 

Or am I just going crazy?  
Now, my brain's  
just bein' a lazy  
ass who thinks it's  
just the skies goin' grey, see  
they're clearing, so cheer  
up and chin up  
and come fight me  
for it seems like a lovely  
sunny day to land a punch  
right through the plexus and  
leave you helpless, bleeding crimson, curdling blood  
glinting in the sun, flowing  
between the blades of grass blowing   
in the breeze,  
dipping in and out  
of flesh wounds. 

A peaceful Eden with a bright red puddle.  

Sunday brought sorrow and weighed  
a thousand kilos.  

Monday  
was morose but  
too weak to bear  
the weight. 

Tuesday weeped  
for Monday who sobbed  
in her arms. 

Thursday crushed  
on Friday who  
was busy fucking Saturday  
while Saturday  
was blocking Sunday out  
for being too toxic. 

Perhaps  
the Wednesdays of the world  
are doomed to find peace  
only by becoming  
a puddle in Eden. 

Or maybe  
The Wednesdays will look back  
on their Wednesdays  
and think  
"Man, what the fuck was that?"
