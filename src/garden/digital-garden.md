A digital garden is an online space, usually a publicly accesible website, structured in a manner different to the way most websites are, today. Everything on the Internet seems to be an ephemeral stream of content, there for a moment, lost or archived forever. Obviously, it can be preserved, but the emphasis is on the new and the latest.

A digital garden is quite the opposite - a healthy break from the countless streams of endless content. In a digital garden, every "page" is dedicated to an atomic idea, and, just like a garden, all the ideas are carefully maintained and nurtured and allowed to grow. Some wither and die - and that's fine. There is no pressure to churn out content, no race to stay relevant, no fixed structure. It is merely a collection a of thoughts and ideas essays and any kind of content, richly linked to each other. Any idea can be linked to any other and "nourished" independently.
